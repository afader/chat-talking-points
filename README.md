# chat-talking-points

## [Click here for a demo](http://afader.github.io/chat-talking-points/)

This is a project to play with some ideas for a chat room interface. The chat
interface is augmented with talking points. Talking points are issues that can
be referenced during the conversation. Users in the chat room can reference 
the talking points a la github issues in pull request discussions.

(This is also a project for me to learn about javascript development.)

To run locally:
    
    git clone https://github.com/afader/chat-talking-points
    cd chat-talking-points
    npm install
    gulp
    
Then open [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/) in a browser. This will let you live-edit the code without having to refresh the browser.
