# cheeseburger-textcomplete
This is a project to play with some ideas for cheeseburger un-therapy. It's also a playground for me to learn how to become a better javascript developer.

Check out the most recent demo here: [http://afader.github.io/cheeseburger-textcomplete/](http://afader.github.io/cheeseburger-textcomplete/)
