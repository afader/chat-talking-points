# cheeseburger-textcomplete

[Demo](http://afader.github.io/cheeseburger-textcomplete/)

This is a project to play with some ideas for cheeseburger un-therapy. It's also a playground for me to learn how to become a better javascript developer.

To run locally:
    
    git clone http://afader.github.io/cheeseburger-textcomplete
    cd cheeseburger-textcomplete
    npm install
    gulp
    
Then open [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/) in a browser. This will let you live-edit the code without having to refresh the browser.
